# COMP4420-Course-Project

This was a project I did for COMP4420 Advanced Design and Analysis of Algorithms back in the Winter 2016 semester. Its purpose was to
read in a file containing vertices and coordinates of a polyhedra, display it, and be able to manipulate it. For further information,
see the README.txt file.
